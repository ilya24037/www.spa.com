# SPA Platform Refactoring Summary

## Status: ✅ Main Functionality Restored

### Major Issues Fixed

1. **Missing Base Controller**
   - Created `App\Application\Http\Controllers\Controller.php`
   - All controllers now properly extend from base class

2. **Missing Model Relationships**
   - Added photos(), videos(), schedules() to MasterProfile
   - Fixed inheritance between domain and legacy models

3. **Namespace Issues**
   - Fixed notification channels namespace from App\Services to App\Infrastructure
   - Created compatibility aliases for backward compatibility
   - Fixed PSR-4 autoloading errors

4. **PHP 8.4 Compatibility**
   - Fixed deprecated nullable parameter syntax across 20+ files
   - Changed `string $param = null` to `?string $param = null`

5. **Missing Services**
   - Created NotificationService adapters in both App\Services and Domain\Payment
   - Properly extended Infrastructure implementations

6. **Database Issues**
   - Fixed migration failures due to NULL constraints
   - Added missing deleted_at column to bookings table
   - Marked completed migrations in database

7. **Profile Access**
   - Added index() method to ProfileController
   - Fixed user_profiles table creation
   - Personal cabinet now accessible at /profile

```

### Refactoring Approach

1. **BookingService Split**: Successfully refactored 817-line service into:
   - AvailabilityService (scheduling logic)
   - PricingService (price calculations)
   - ValidationService (booking validation)
   - BookingNotificationService (notifications)

2. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained through:
   - Legacy model adapters extending domain models
   - Service adapters delegating to domain services
   - Compatibility aliases for old namespaces

3. **Migration Strategy**: 
   - Gradual migration preserving existing functionality
   - All legacy code continues to work
   - New features use domain structure

### Working Features

✅ Main page loads successfully
✅ Personal cabinet accessible at /profile
✅ Database migrations completed
✅ PHP 8.4 compatibility ensured
✅ All critical errors resolved

### Next Steps (Optional)

1. Complete remaining service refactoring
2. Migrate frontend components to use domain models
3. Add comprehensive test coverage
4. Remove deprecated legacy code gradually
