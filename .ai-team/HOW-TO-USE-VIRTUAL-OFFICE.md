## üîß STEP 10: ADDITIONAL COMMANDS

### PowerShell commands (for advanced users):
```powershell
# Navigate to scripts folder
cd C:\www.spa.com\.ai-team\scripts

# Create task directly
.\task-manager.ps1 -Action create -Title "Task name" -Assignee backend -Priority high

# Send message
.\message-router.ps1 -Action send -From ceo -To all -Message "Important message"

## ‚úÖ READY TO WORK!

Now you know how to:
1. ‚úÖ Start Virtual Office
2. ‚úÖ Create tasks for agents
3. ‚úÖ Communicate with team via chat
4. ‚úÖ Use Dashboard
5. ‚úÖ Check metrics and results

### üí° TIP TO START:
Begin with a simple task for TeamLead, for example:
"Create plan for adding new search feature"

TeamLead will automatically distribute work among all agents!

---

## üö® TROUBLESHOOTING

### If agents ask for theme selection:
‚úÖ **FIXED!** The system now includes:
- Settings file at: `C:\www.spa.com\.ai-team\.claude\settings.json`
- Launcher uses `--settings-file` parameter
- Agents start without prompts

### If chat server doesn't start:
1. Check Node.js is installed: `node --version`
2. Check port 8082 is free: `netstat -an | findstr 8082`
3. Try running directly: `node C:\www.spa.com\.ai-team\ai-team-server.cjs`

### If Python CEO Interface doesn't work:
1. Check Python is installed: `python --version`
2. Install required modules: `pip install pathlib`
3. Run directly: `python C:\www.spa.com\.ai-team\virtual-office\ceo_interface_en.py`

### If agents don't respond:
1. Check 5 PowerShell windows are open
2. Look for errors in agent windows
3. Check chat.md is accessible
4. Restart with `START-VIRTUAL-OFFICE-EN.bat`
